# C - Malloc, free

This repo contains code written to understand `malloc` and `free`.

### On Buffer Size

The buffer size of 1024 bytes is a common default size for reading input from a file or console. It’s not too small that it would cause performance issues by requiring too many reads, but it’s also not too large that it would waste memory. However, this size can be adjusted based on your specific use case.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

| `1-strdup.c`             | `char *_strdup(char *str);`                            |
| `2-str_concat.c`         | `char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);`                |
| `3-alloc_grid.c`         | `int **alloc_grid(int width, int height);`             |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee**
  * C function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific `char`.
    * Returns `NULL` if size = `0`
    * Returns a pointer to the array, or `NULL` if it fails

* **1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings**
  * C function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
    * The `_strdup()` function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string `str`. Memory for the new string is obtained with `malloc`, and can be freed with `free`.
    * Returns `NULL` if str = NULL
    * On success, the `_strdup` function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns `NULL` if insufficient memory was available.

* **2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life**
  * C function that concatenates two strings.
    * The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of `s1`, followed by the contents of `s2`, and null terminated
    * if `NULL` is passed, treat it as an empty string
    * The function should return `NULL` on failure
 
* **3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize**
  * C function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
    * Each element of the grid should be initialized to `0`
    * The function should return `NULL` on failure
    * If `width` or `height` is `0` or negative, return `NULL`

* **4. It's not bragging if you can back it up**
  * C function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

* **5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe**
  * C function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
    * Returns `NULL` if `ac == 0` or `av == NULL`
    * Returns a pointer to a new string, or `NULL` if it fails
    * Each argument should be followed by a `\n` in the new string

* **6. I will show you how great I am**
  * C function that splits a string into words.
    * The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)
    * Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
    * The last element of the returned array should be `NULL`
    * Words are separated by spaces
    * Returns `NULL` if `str == NULL` or `str == ""`
    * If your function fails, it should return `NULL`
