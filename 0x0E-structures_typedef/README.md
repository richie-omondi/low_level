# C - Structures, typedef

This repo contains code written to understand the structures in C

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Poppy**
  * Define a new `struct` dog.

* **1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself**
  * Write a function that initialize a variable of `type struct dog`

* **2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad**
  * Write a function that prints a struct dog
    * Prototype: `void print_dog(struct dog *d)`;
    * If an element of `d` is `NULL`, print `(nil)` instead of this element. (if `name` is `NULL`, print `Name: (nil)`)
    * If `d` is `NULL` print nothing.
 
* **3. Function-like Macro**
  * Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

* **4. SUM**
  * Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

**Note**:
Always use the guards `#ifndef FILE_NAME_H` followed by `#define FILE_NAME_H` at the beginning of all header files and end with `#endif` to prevent compilation errors.
