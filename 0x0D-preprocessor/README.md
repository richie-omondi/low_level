# C - Preprocessor

This repo contains code written to understand the compilation process, preprocessor directives in C and macros.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Object-like Macro**
  * Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

* **1. Pi**
  * Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

* **2. File name**
  * Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
 
* **3. Function-like Macro**
  * Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

* **4. SUM**
  * Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

**Note**:
Always use the guards `#ifndef FILE_NAME_H` followed by `#define FILE_NAME_H` at the beginning of all header files and end with `#endif` to prevent compilation errors.
