# Linear and Binary Search Algorithms

## What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size 

The **space complexity of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n is O(1)**. This is because the algorithm only requires a constant amount of space to store the variables used in the search, regardless of the size of the input array. The **time complexity of an iterative linear search algorithm is O(n), which means that the worst-case scenario is that the algorithm will have to search through the entire array to find the target element**. If you need more information, I can look up more details on the web.
